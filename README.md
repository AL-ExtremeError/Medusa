This guide will provide information, walk-thru's and files for a CoreXY Conversion of an Elegoo Neptune 4 Max 3d Printer which I call, Medusa.

This build is an overhaul of my previous conversion, Hephaestus (https://github.com/AL-ExtremeError/Hephaestus.github.io).
Although this was an overhaul, it could be built from scratch without the [Hephaestus](https://github.com/AL-ExtremeError/Hephaestus.github.io) build.

****

Upgrades & Modifications contained in this build from previous build:

**Please Note:** Not all items below are mandatory to replace, I just chose to for my build.

- Quad Z Leveling (Must have 4 stepper motors; Will need to source 2 additional motors)
  - New 42x48 Stepper Motors (Not Mandatory, I chose to use all brand new stepper motors)
- BigTreeTech PI (Not Mandatory, Elegoo's MCU will work just fine)
- Octopus Pro v1.1 MCU (Not Mandatory, Elegoo's MCU will work just fine; Will need to source a secondary MCU for additional Stepper motors)
- 24V 600W Power Supply (Will need to source in order to power the additional stepper motors and secondary mcu board / Btt PI & Octopus Pro v1.1)
- End Stop Switches

****

**Disclaimer:** This build is a DIY and at your own risk. There is no affiliation with Elegoo, Partners or vendors. I am not being compensated in my way for this. This walk-thru is strictly based on my own experience of my own personal challenge. I am not responsible for any mistakes, mis-interpretations and /or but not limited to mis-understandings. If something in this walk-thru is not clear or you would like to provide feedback (Good, Bad or Indifferent), please feel free reach out. I welcome all feedback and I am more than happy to answer / help walk-thru as best as I can.

**Please Note:** Under the Build Documentation section, the links are listed in the order in which this build was done.
